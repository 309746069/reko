A command-line, a Windows GUI,\r\nand a ASP.NET front end exist at the time of writing.  The decompiler\r\nengine receives inputs from the front ends in the form of either\r\nindividual executable files or decompiler project files. Reko\r\nproject files contain additional information about a binary file,\r\nhelpful to the decompilation process or for formatting the output.\r\nThe decompiler engine then proceeds to analyze the source code.\r\n\r\nPlease note that many software licenses prohibit decompilation or\r\nother reverse engineering of their machine code binaries. Use this\r\ndecompiler only if you have legal rights to decompiler the binary\r\n(for instance if the binary is your own.) \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
